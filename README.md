## Anti-vaxxing has been brewing for a long time

Between 2000 and 2013, 86.21% of California counties saw an decrease in the percent of kindergarten students who had received a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In both years, the northern part of the state, covering counties including Lassen, Trinity, and Nevada, had the lowest rates of MMR-vaccinated kindergarteners. 

This story would look at why this specific region has been so vaccine-averse, and why it continues to become even moreso. I would look at COVID-19 vaccine data to see whether adults also are experiencing low rates, to try to understand if this is an issue of general distrust in vaccines or a fear of children (specifically kindergarteners) reacting poorly to vaccines.

Reich studies why families interact in different ways with healthcare and welfare-related issues. I think she could help explain the sociology of why entire communities become under-vaccinated, and why overall vaccine rates are dropping.

Salmon is an expert specializing in research concerning epidemiology and public health policy. He could help describe the potential impacts and dangers of low vaccine rates.
