# J124 FINAL Project
## Anti-vaxxing has been brewing for a long time

Between 2000 and 2013, 86.21% of California counties saw an decrease in the percent of kindergarten students who had received a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In both years, the northern part of the state, covering counties including Lassen, Trinity, and Nevada, had the lowest rates of MMR-vaccinated kindergarteners. For this project, 2013 was the most recent year I used because there was incomplete data in all subsequent years.

This story would look at why this specific region has been so vaccine-averse. I would look at COVID-19 vaccine data to see whether adults also are experiencing low rates, to try to understand if this is an issue of general distrust in vaccines. I would also look into how California's [2015 vaccine law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB277), that eliminated personal beliefs exemptions (PBE), has changed the percentage of students vaccinated, and see if any lessons could be learned from that for current vaccination issues.

Reich studies why families interact in different ways with healthcare and welfare-related issues. I think she could help explain the sociology of why entire communities become under-vaccinated, and why overall vaccine rates are dropping.

Salmon is an expert specializing in research concerning epidemiology and public health policy. He could help describe the potential impacts and dangers of low vaccine rates.

<p>Looking at this COVID-19 vaccination data would be a way to see whether the areas with low vaccine rates in 2013 are still choosing to not vaccinate when a vaccine is optional. It would also be helpful, because all vaccine-eligible people are over the age of 12, to see whether this is an entire community issue, or whether people are more hesitant to vaccinate very young children compared to older children/adults.


**[Getting Personal: How Childhood Vaccination Policies Shape the Landscape of Vaccine Exemptions](https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/7/3/ofaa088/5805242) from *Open Forum Infectious Diseases***
<p>This peer-reviewed paper analyzes the impact of non-medical exemptions (NME), in California called PBEs, on vaccine rates, as well as the effect of restricting NMEs. Understanding how NME restrictions have changed California's kindergarten vaccination rates could provide guidance on how to deal with other low vaccine rates.
