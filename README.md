## Anti-vaxxing has been brewing for a long time

Between 2000 and 2013, 86.21% of California counties saw an decrease in the percent of kindergarten students who had received a measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. In both years, the northern part of the state, covering counties including Lassen, Trinity, and Nevada, had the lowest rates of MMR-vaccinated kindergarteners. 

This story would look at why this specific region has been so vaccine-averse, and why it continues to become even moreso. I would look at COVID-19 vaccine data to see whether adults also are experiencing low rates, to try to understand if this is an issue of general distrust in vaccines or a fear of children (specifically kindergarteners) reacting poorly to vaccines.
